# Hand Gesture Control with OpenCV and MediaPipe
Overview
This project demonstrates real-time hand gesture control using OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries. It allows you to control your computer's cursor and perform a single click using hand gestures captured through your webcam.

# Requirements
Python 3.9<br>
OpenCV<br>
MediaPipe<br>
NumPy<br>
pyautogui<br>
win32api<br>

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-control.git

## Navigate to the project directory:

cd hand-gesture-control

## Install the required Python packages using pip:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pyautogui pywin32
   
A window titled "Hand Tracking" will open, displaying the webcam feed with hand landmarks and connections.

Perform hand gestures in front of your webcam. The program will track your hand and control the cursor accordingly.

To perform a single click, bring your index finger and thumb close together.

To exit the program, press the 'q' key in the "Hand Tracking" window.<br>
